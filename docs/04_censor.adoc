== How to ignore `<div>`s that keep on changing its view

Many websites contain `<div>` elements that display some commercial advertisement, that keep on changing dynamically. These dynamic HTML elements disturbs visual comparison of 2 screenshots taken at different timing / form different URLs. These dynamic `<div>`s will highly likely to be different; which result some significant % of image-diff. I want to ignore those dynamic HTML elements in image comparison. How can I do it?

You can optionally paint the square regions of selected HTML elements in the screenshot images in grey color. I would call it : *Censoring* (検閲、塗りつぶし). See an example of *censored* page image:

Please find the clock area is painted grey.
