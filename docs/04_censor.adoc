== How to ignore `<div>`s that keep on changing its view

Many websites contain `<div>` elements that display some commercial advertisements, that keep on changing dynamically. These dynamic HTML elements disturbs visual comparison of 2 screenshots taken at different timings. These dynamic `<div>`s will be visually different; which results some % of image difference. However, I am not interested in the image difference caused by the advertisements or clock. Rather, I want to ignore those dynamic HTML elements in image comparison. How can I do it?

You can optionally paint the square regions of selected HTML elements in the screenshot images in grey color. I would call it : *Censoring* (検閲、塗りつぶし). See an example of *censored* page image:

.Censoring example
|===
|original | with censoring

| image:images/no_censor.png[]

|image:images/with_censor.png[]
|===

Please find the clock area is painted grey. You can do image comparison of 2 screenshots both of which are censored. Possibly, the painted area would no longer cause significant difference.
