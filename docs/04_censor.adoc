== How to ignore `<div>`s that keep on changing its view

Many websites contain `<div>` elements that display commercial advertisements that keep on changing dynamically everytime inquired. These dynamic HTML elements disturb visual comparison of 2 screenshots taken at different timings. These dynamic `<div>`s will result significant % of image difference. However, I am not interested in the image difference caused by the advertisements. Therefore, I want to ignore those dynamic HTML elements for more accurate image comparison. How can I do it?

You can optionally gray paint the square regions of the selected HTML elements in the screenshot images. I would call it : *Censoring* (検閲、塗りつぶし). See an example of *censored* page image as follows:

Please find the clock area is painted grey. You can do image comparison of 2 screenshots both of which are censored. Possibly, the painted area would no longer cause significant difference.
